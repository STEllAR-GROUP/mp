About **NT**:sup:`2`
--------------------
The **Numerical Template Toolbox** (**NT**:sup:`2`) is an Open Source C++ library
aimed at simplifying the development, debugging and optimization of high-performance
computing application by providing a **Matlab** like syntax that ease the transition
between prototype and actual application.

So What is This About ?
:::::::::::::::::::::::
This repository contains in its branches various optional modules for **NT**:sup:`2` that covers
various mathematical functions sets, new types or algorithms to be used directly with **NT**:sup:`2`.
